# Hello World

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))

* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
* What is the Zen of Python
* How to use the Python interpreter
* How to print text and variables using print
* How to use strings
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
* What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with PEP 8

**1. Run inline**

    Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

**2. Hello, print**

    Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a
multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
Use the function print

**3. Print integer mandatory**

    Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
The output of the script should be:
* The number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a string
* Your code must be 3 lines long
* You have to use the new print numbers tips

**4. Print float mandatory**

    Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

The output of the program should be:
* Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits
* followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to cast number to string
* You have to use the new print formatting tips

**5. Print string**

    Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.
The output of the program should be:
* 3 times the value of str
* followed by a new line
* followed by the 9 first characters of str
* followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
* Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

**6. Play with strings**

    Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
* You have to use the variables str1 and str2 in your new line of code
* Your program should be exactly 5 lines long

**7. Copy - Cut - Paste**
* You can find the source code here
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
* Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
* word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
* word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
* middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

**8. Create a new sentence**

    Complete this source code to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line.
* You can find the source code here
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
* Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
* You are not allowed to create new variables
* You are not allowed to use string literals

**9. Easter Egg mandatory**

    Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.
* Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)

**10. Linked list cycle mandatory**

    Technical interview preparation:
    Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
* You are not allowed to google anything
* Whiteboard first
* Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
* Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle.

```Requirements:```
Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free
