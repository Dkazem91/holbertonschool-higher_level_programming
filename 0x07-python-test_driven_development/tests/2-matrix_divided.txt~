 How to 2-matrix_divided.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``matrix_divided()``.

Numbers
=======

``matrix_divided()`` returns a new matrix of all elements
 divided by a divider variable.

all ints
::
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

ints and floats and negatives
::
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [[1.5,2.0,3.0],[4.0,-5.0,-6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.5, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

check empty list
::
    >>> matrix = [[],[]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix,3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
