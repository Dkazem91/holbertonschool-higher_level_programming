### What you should learn from this project

**At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:**

* Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use the while and for loops
* How is the Python’s for different from the C‘s?
* How to use the break and continues statements
* How to use else clauses on loops
* What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
* How to use range
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does return a function that does not use any return statement
* Scope of variables
* What’s a traceback
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

**0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

    This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source  code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

**1. The last digit**
    
    This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number
    each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print
    the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

You can find the source code here
* The variable number will store a different value every time you will
  run this program
* You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do
  not touch this code
  ```The output of the program should be:```
  
* The string Last digit of, followed by
    the number, followed by
    the string is, followed by
* if the number is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
* if the number is 0: the string and is 0
* if the number is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
* followed by a new line

**2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia.**

    And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
    Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a
    new line.

* You can only use one print function with string format
* You can only use one loop in your code
* You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
* You are not allowed to import any module

**3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
    
    Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a
    new line.

* Print all the letters except q and e

**4. Hexadecimal printing**

    Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in
    hexadecimal (as in the following example)

* You can only use one print function with string format
* You can only use one loop in your code
* You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
* You are not allowed to import any module

**5. 00...99 mandatory**

    Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

* Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
* The last number should be followed by a new line
* You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format
* You can only use one loop in your code
* You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
* You are not allowed to import any module

**6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials.**

    The more brains you use, the less material you need

* Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
* Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
* The two digits must be different
* 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
* Print only the smallest combination of two digits
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
* The last number should be followed by a new line
* You can only use no more than 3 print functions with string format
* You can only use no more than 2 loops in your code
* You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
* You are not allowed to import any module

**7. islower**

    Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

* Prototype: def islower(c):
* Returns True if c is lowercase
* Returns False otherwise
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use str.upper() and str.isupper()
* Tips: ord()
* You don’t need to understand __import__

**8. To uppercase**
    Write a function that print a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

* Prototype: def uppercase(str):
* You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format
* You can only use one loop in your code
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use str.upper() and str.isupper()
* Tips: ord()
* You don’t need to understand __import__

**9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; its what we do with them that's important**

    Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

* Prototype: def print_last_digit(number):
* Returns the value of the last digit
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You don’t need to understand __import__

**10. a + b**

    Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

* Prototype: def add(a, b):
* Returns the value of a + b
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You don’t need to understand __import__

**11. a ^ b**

    Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

* Prototype: def pow(a, b):
* Returns the value of a ^ b
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You don’t need to understand __import__

**12. Fizz Buzz**

    Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

* For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of
  five print Buzz.
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
* Prototype: def fizzbuzz():
* Each element should be followed by a space
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You don’t need to understand __import__

**13. Insert in sorted linked list**

    Technical interview preparation:
    You are not allowed to google anything
    Whiteboard first
    Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

* Prototype: listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);
* Return: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
